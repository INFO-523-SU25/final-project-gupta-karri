        "A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is the **Credit Card Customer Data** sourced from Kaggle. It consists of **8,950 rows** and **18 columns**, each representing anonymized customer data related to credit card usage. The features include various behavioral indicators such as balance, purchase amounts, cash advances, credit limits, and payment patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why we chose this dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "We chose this credit card dataset from Kaggle because it contains detailed information about nearly 9,000 credit card users. It includes data such as their spending habits, payment frequency, and cash advances. This makes it a good dataset for identifying different types of customers and detecting unusual behavior. Additionally, we can use it to predict customers who might stop using their cards or switch to other providers, assess the risk of issuing credit cards to customers, and identify opportunities for targeted offers and credit limit increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Aim \n",
        "\n",
        "Our group is working on a project titled \"Behavioral Outlier Segmentation,\" which involves analyzing credit card usage data from Kaggle to identify unusual customer behavior patterns. The primary goal of this project is to uncover customer segments that behave similarly but exhibit patterns that deviate from typical usage. These unusual behaviors may include excessive use of cash advances, irregular payment activity, abnormally high or low spending, or infrequent use of the credit card. Additionally, we aim to predict customers who may stop using their cards and switch to competitors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\n",

        "## Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "The two questions you want to answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. We identify clusters of credit card customers based on their transaction behavior (recency, frequency, and monetary value) to detect atypical patterns and classify customers into risk levels (high, medium, low). \n",
        "\n",
        "2. We predict which customers might stop using their credit cards or switch to a competitor.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risk Level Definitions\n",
        "\n",
        "We will define customer risk levels based on the following criteria:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **High Risk**: Customers with excessive cash advances (>75th percentile), irregular payments (low PRCFULLPAYMENT), and high balance-to-credit-limit ratios (>0.8)\n",
        "- **Medium Risk**: Customers with moderate cash advances (25th-75th percentile), occasional late payments, and balance-to-credit-limit ratios between 0.4-0.8\n",
        "- **Low Risk**: Customers with minimal cash advances (<25th percentile), consistent full payments, and balance-to-credit-limit ratios <0.4\n",
        "\n",
        "## Target Variable Creation for Prediction\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the dataset doesn't contain churn/attrition labels, we will create a synthetic target variable based on behavioral indicators that typically precede customer churn:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Churn Indicators**: Low purchase frequency (<0.3), declining payment amounts, high cash advance usage, and irregular payment patterns\n",
        "- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (1 = likely to churn, 0 = likely to stay) based on composite risk score\n",

        "## Data Preprocessing Plan\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Quality Assessment**: Handle missing values, check for duplicates, identify outliers\n",
        "2. **Feature Engineering**: Create derived features like balance-to-credit-limit ratio, payment-to-purchase ratio\n",
        "3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to reduce 18 features to 8-10 principal components for clustering\n",
        "4. **Scaling**: Standardize numerical features using StandardScaler\n",
        "5. **Feature Selection**: Use correlation analysis and domain knowledge to select most relevant features\n",
        "\n",
        "## Analysis plan\n",
        "\n",
        "-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use a type of machine learning called clustering to group customers who have similar spending and payment habits. This method helps us find clear groups of customers who behave alike. It also helps us spot customers who donâ€™t fit into any group. \n",
        "\n",
        "For the second part of our project, we want to predict which customers might stop using their credit cards or switch to a different company. To do this, we will use prediction models that learn data about customer behavior.\n",
