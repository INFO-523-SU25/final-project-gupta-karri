Detect clusters of customers by transaction behavior (recency, frequency, monetary) and classify risk levels (high, medium, low) \n![credit card](img/credit.png){ width=300px }\n2. Predict which customers might churn or switch to competitors\n\n\n# Analytical Approach\n\n- Using **cluster techniques** to group customers based on spending, payment frequency, and transaction history to identify common behavioral segments  \n- Using **regression analysis** to predict the likelihood of customer churn for each individual based on behavioral patterns and segment  \n- Tailor retention strategies based on behavioral segments\n\n\n# Business Challenges\n\n**Problem 1: We Don’t Know Our Customers**\n- Without behavioral segmentation, we treat all customers the same  \n- High-risk users go unnoticed; best clients are not rewarded\n\n**Problem 2: Customers Leave Without Warning**\n- Customer churn is expensive: acquiring a new customer costs 5x more than retention  \n- Need to predict potential churners proactively\n\n\n# Work Flow\n\n**EDA**  \n   ↓  \n**Data Preprocessing**  \n   ↓  \n**Feature Engineering & Selection**  \n   ↓  \n**Clustering & Evaluation**  \n   ↓  \n**Select Best Clustering Algorithm**  \n   ↓  \n**Visualization of Clusters**\n\n# Outlier Detection & Skewness....\n## Outliers\n![](img/boxplots.png){ width=500px }\n\n## Segments\n![](img/skewness_histograms.png){ width=500px }\n\n## After transformation \n![](img/skewness.png){ width=500px }\n- After applying transformations, the skewness of most numerical features was **significantly reduced**\n\n\n## Summary of Cluster Algorithms\n![](img/summary.png){ width=500px }\n **K-Means (k=3) produced 3 clusters** with a moderate Silhouette Score (0.233), indicating some separation between clusters but not very strong.  \n\n## Clsuter Elbow curve\n![](img/Elbow.png){ width=500px }\n- The Elbow Curve indicates that **4 clusters** capture most of the variation in the data.   \n- Therefore, we divide customers into **4 behavioral segments** for further analysis.\n\n## Clusters based on behavior \n![](img/cluster.png){ width=700px }\n```\n\n## Customer Risk Label Distribution\n![](img/Label.png){ width=500px }\n- Most customers fall into **Low Risk (4,343)** and **Medium Risk (1,990)** categories.  \n- A smaller number of customers are in **Very High Risk (207)** and **Extreme Risk (83)**\n\n# Limitations:\n\n1.  \n\n2. \n\n# Acknowledgment\n\n-   Thank you, Professor Greg Chism, for your guidance, support, and valuable feedback throughout this project.\n\n-   Thank you to my classmates and team members for their collaboration, insights, and contributions.\n\n",
