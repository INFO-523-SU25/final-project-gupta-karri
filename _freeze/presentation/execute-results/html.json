Detect clusters of customers by transaction behavior (recency, frequency, monetary) and classify risk levels (high, medium, low) \n\n![credit card](img/credit.png){ width=300px }\n\n2. Predict which customers might churn or switch to competitors\n\n---\n\n## Analytical Approach\n\n- Using **cluster techniques** to group customers based on spending, payment frequency, and transaction history to identify common behavioral segments  \n- Using **regression analysis** to predict the likelihood of customer churn for each individual based on behavioral patterns and segment  \n- Tailor retention strategies based on behavioral segments\n\n---\n\n## Business Challenges\n\n**Problem 1: We Don't Know Our Customers**\n\n- Without behavioral segmentation, we treat all customers the same  \n- High-risk users go unnoticed; best clients are not rewarded\n\n**Problem 2: Customers Leave Without Warning**\n\n- Customer churn is expensive: acquiring a new customer costs 5x more than retention  \n- Need to predict potential churners proactively\n\n---\n\n## Work Flow\n\n*EDA*\n   ↓  \n*Data Preprocessing*\n   ↓  \n*Feature Engineering & Selection*\n   ↓  \n*Clustering & Evaluation*  // *Churn Prediction Modeling*  \n   ↓  \n*Select Best Clustering Algorithm*  // *Feature Importance Analysis*\n   ↓  \n*Visualization of Clusters* \n\n   ↓  \n*Business Insights & Recommendations*\n\n---\n\n## Outlier Detection\n\n![](img/boxplots.png){ width=500px }\n\n**Outlier Summary:**\n\n- **BALANCE**: 695 outliers\n\n- **PURCHASES**: 808 outliers \n\n- **CASH_ADVANCE**: 1,030 outliers\n\n- **MINIMUM_PAYMENTS**: 841 outliers\n\n## Distribution Analysis\n![](img/skewness_histograms.png){ width=500px }\n\n**Skewness Issues Identified:**\n\n- MINIMUM_PAYMENTS**: 13.62 (extremely skewed)\n\n- ONEOFF_PURCHASES**: 10.05 (highly skewed)\n\n- PURCHASES**: 8.14 (highly skewed)\n\n## After Transformation\n![](img/skewness.png){ width=500px }\n\n- After applying transformations, the skewness of most numerical features was **significantly reduced**\n- Box-Cox** and **Yeo-Johnson** transformations applied for highly skewed features\n- Square root** and **cube root** transformations for moderately skewed features\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Cluster Algorithms\n![](img/Summary.png){ width=500px }\n\n **K-Means (k=3) produced 3 clusters** with a moderate Silhouette Score (0.233), indicating some separation between clusters but not very strong.  \n\n---\n\n## Cluster Elbow Curve\n![](img/Elbow.png){ width=500px }\n\n- The Elbow Curve indicates that **4 clusters** capture most of the variation in the data.   \n- Therefore, we divide customers into **4 behavioral segments** for further analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Clusters based on behavior \n![](img/cluster.png){ width=700px }\n\n- Cluster 0: Low balance, low purchases, low risk\n- Cluster 1: Medium balance, medium purchases, medium risk  \n- Cluster 2: High balance, high purchases, high risk\n- Cluster 3: Very high balance, very high purchases, extreme risk\n\n\n---\n\n## Customer Risk Label Distribution\n![](img/Label.png){ width=500px }\n\n- Most customers fall into **Low Risk (261)** and **Medium Risk (6,139)** categories.  \n- A smaller number of customers are in **High Risk (2,453)** and **Extreme Risk (97)**\n\n---\n\n## Churn Prediction Analysis\n## Feature Correlation Analysis\n- **Highly correlated features (>0.8):**\n  - PURCHASES ↔ ONEOFF_PURCHASES: 0.917\n  - PURCHASES_FREQUENCY ↔ PURCHASES_INSTALLMENTS_FREQUENCY: 0.863\n- These correlations help identify redundant features for model training\n\n*Note: Correlation matrix heatmap would be generated during analysis*\n\n## Churn Target Creation\n- **Synthetic churn target** created using composite risk scoring\n- **Churn rate: 25.01%** (2,238 out of 8,950 customers)\n\n**Target Distribution:**\n- **Non-Churn Customers**: 6,712 (74.99%)\n- **Churn Customers**: 2,238 (25.01%)\n\n**Risk factors considered:**\n- Low purchase frequency\n- High cash advance usage\n- Irregular payment patterns\n- High balance-to-credit ratio\n- Risk indicators\n\n## Model Evaluation Results\n\n![](img/confusion_matrix.png){ width=600px }\n\n| Metric | Score |\n|--------|-------|\n| **Test Set ROC-AUC** | 0.9994 |\n| **Accuracy** | 98.94% |\n| **Precision** | 98.42% |\n| **Recall** | 97.32% |\n| **F1-Score** | 97.87% |\n\n## Acknowledgment\n\n-   Thank you, Professor Greg Chism, for your guidance, support, and valuable feedback throughout this project.\n\n-   Thank you to my classmates and team members for their collaboration, insights, and contributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
